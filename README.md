## Overview

We all know (hopefully) by now that documentation is important for every piece of product and even service out there. Be it end users doc or internal doc addressed to developers, engineers, managers, etc., we all need a good documentation.

There is no **one way** to write technical documentation as there is no **only one** type of technical documentation. The way we write docs in the Automotive industry is different than in Aeronautics or for a Sofware product. 

All in all, the path you take as a technical writer depends on where you want to work and what you want to write.

I currently write software documentation using Markdown so I'll focus on that for the moment.

## Prerequisites

**1**. I would say the first important thing for a technical writer is good grammar. Seems obvious but you need to read a lot of different books, articles, docs in various fields to acquire as much vocabulary as you can. It also helps seeing how different docs are presented.

**2**. You should not be afraid.
   - Making mistakes is normal. Learn to re-read yourself as much as needed without overdoing it.
   - Not understanding a concept or a product is normal, especially if you don't have an engineering background.
   - Asking (Google) for help is normal. Do not hesitate to ask a developer or someone who knows about the product/service.

**3**. Learn a documentation language. You need to know at least one standard language of documentation. I will put a link to a few of them below:
  - *General*
    - [DITA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/11347/ditaref-book.pdf)
    - [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
    - [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)

  - *Specific*
    - [ReST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)
    - [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)
  
  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #ccc;">You don't really need to learn those as they are very specific to a programming language documentation.</blockquote>
