## Overview

We all know (hopefully) by now that documentation is important for every piece of product and even service out there. Be it end users doc or internal doc addressed to developers, engineers, managers, etc., we all need a good documentation.

There is no **one way** to write technical documentation as there is no **only one** type of technical documentation. The way we write docs in the Automotive industry is different than in Aeronautics or for a Sofware product. 

All in all, the path you take as a technical writer depends on where you want to work and what you want to write.

I currently write software documentation using Markdown so I'll focus on that for the moment.

## Prerequisites

**1**. Good grammar. Seems obvious but you need to read a lot of different books, articles, docs in various fields to acquire as much vocabulary as you can. It also helps seeing how different docs are presented.

I recommend:
   - The [Simplified Technical English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English) to learn how to write better instructions.
   - [Minimalism](https://clickhelp.com/clickhelp-technical-writing-blog/minimalism-in-technical-documentation/) for simple and easy to understand writing.

**2**. Do not be afraid.
   - Making mistakes is normal. Learn to re-read yourself as much as needed without overdoing it.
   - Not understanding a concept or a product is normal, especially if you don't have an engineering background.
   - Asking (Google) for help is normal. Do not hesitate to ask a developer or someone who knows about the product/service.

**3**. Learn a documentation language. You need to know at least one standard language of documentation. I will put a link to a few of them below:
  - *General*
    - [DITA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/11347/ditaref-book.pdf)
    - [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
    - [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)

  - *Specific*
    - [ReST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)
    - [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)
  
  <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #ccc;">You don't really need to learn those as they are very specific to a programming language documentation.</blockquote>
  
## Best Practices

### Make it clear

I have noticed while looking for documentation myself that people and companies always assume to know who their end user is. The target of your product is not necessarily the person who will read your doc. I had a devOps engineer help me install something on my computer and even him couldn't figure out the doc. I always have a beginner version of the doc I write and put it in the FAQs section to make sure everything is clear.

### Create a FAQ

It is simpler for the human brain to understand a concept if it comes in the form of a question (This is not peer reviewed science but trust me on this one). That is not to say to only put questions in your docs, please don't do that. My point is, go deeper over every single step in the FAQ. One concept in your doc can become 3 questions in the FAQ.

### Troubleshooting

That one is optional depending on what you write on but here you can make a more advanced version of an FAQ. I know some people don't like to write simple doc and prefer the highly technical one so there you go.
